## 🏁 One Sentence Pitch

There are many pre-med specific majors including the common biology and chemistry, but what happens when we combine both of them. How much course work is there? Is it a lot of work? What do I need to know to succeed as a biochemistry major?

## 🔬 Show Details

- **Title**: Senior on Biochemistry?
- **Host**: Me!
- **Guest**: Senior who is taking biochem, and some insights from a biochem professor

## 📝 Show Objectives

- **Objective One**: Help students make a decision if they are on the verge of picking the major.
- **Objective Two**: Bring more awareness to the major to students.
- **Objective Three**: Inform students of what the major entails.

## 📚 Sample Questions

- **Question One**: What compelled you to choose biochemistry as a major over all of the other pre-med majors that are available?
- **Question Two**: How much course work do you have weekly as a biochem major?
- **Question Three**: What minor best complimented best with your major?

- **Justification for Question One**: This will allow the listeners to understand the benefits of being a biochemistry major rather than only being in biology or only in chemistry.
- **Justification for Question Two**: This gives insight on how much time that a listener needs to spend within a biochemistry major to help them plan in the future.
- **Justification for Question Three**: This gives liseners more knowledge on another path that could be considered similar or something that is completely different from the original and non-creative majors or paths to/for pre-med.

## 🎉 Show Description

The plan is to start the episode with introductions and what year. Then, I will be introducing the aspect of biochemistry and ask the student how they are doing in class. I plan on getting all of the information that I need, and then editing the parts where we mess up out of the overall show. The plan is to get information about the senior's coursework and other information.

I could also ask about specific teachers and ways that they studies for tests and little tips and tricks for the classes that they have taken. Another thing that would be good to highlight would have to be to ask the senior about what courses that they have taken throughout their years. This is because I know that I have had trouble about what classes to take myself as a biochemistry major. I believe that this will help the future students, so that they have a better understanding of the courses and the things that they need to prepare for if they chose to pursue this major.

Overall, the goal is to bring more awareness to the major, and help other people prepare for what they might see in this major. If they need anymore information, they can listen to the show to be more informed.

## 📢 Call to Action

- **Call to Action**: I want the person to have a better undestanding of the major, and what overall they have to do to be prepared maybe even get any advice that hey need for finalizing which major they want to take. This will also allow for the listeners to be sure that they are going into the major that they want to.
